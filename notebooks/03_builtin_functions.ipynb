Some functions enable you to convert data types, and others are specific to a certain type, like strings.\n","\n","We will go through a few of the built-in functions that can be used with numeric data types in Python 3.\n","\n","* `abs()` for absolute value\n","* `divmod()` to find a quotient and remainder simultaneously\n","* `pow()` to raise a number to a certain power\n","* `round()` to round a number to a certain decimal point\n","* `sum()` to calculate the sum of the items in an iterable data type\n","\n","\n","Becoming familiar with these methods can give you more flexibility when programming so that you can make informed decisions when deciding what operators and functions to use.

Absolute Value\n","The built-in function abs() will return the absolute value of a number that you pass to it. In mathematics, absolute value refers to the distance that a number is on the number line from 0. Absolute value does not take into consideration which direction from zero the number lies, meaning that negative numbers will be represented with positive numbers.\n","\n","To give some examples, the absolute value of 15 is 15, the absolute value of -74 is 74, and the absolute value of 0 is 0.\n","\n","Absolute value is an important concept for calculus and real analysis, but it also makes sense when we think about everyday situations like distance travelled. For example, if we are trying to get somewhere that is 58 miles away but we travel 93 miles instead, we overshot our original destination. If we want to calculate now how many miles left to travel to get to the intended destination, we’ll end up with a negative number, but we can’t travel negative miles.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LhpOe8bTfl6G","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n","<b>Exercise 01:</b> Calculate how many miles destination is from current location"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Lju3VLJ4fl6H","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["miles_from_origin = 58  # Miles destination is from origin\n","miles_travelled = 93    # Miles travelled from origin to destination (too many)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wId0kq0sfl6M","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### 2. `divmod` Finding the Quotient and Remainder in One Function\n","Because both floor division (which returns a quotient), and modulo division (which returns a remainder), are closely related, it can be useful to use a function that combines both operations at once.\n","\n","The Python built-in function `divmod()` combines the two, returning first the quotient that comes from floor division, then the remainder.\n","\n","Because `divmod()` will be working with two numbers, we need to pass two numbers to it.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BsnTzz5_fl6N","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n","<b>Exercise 02:</b> Decide how many words per page"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0fhCTwgafl6O","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Let’s say we have written a book that is 80,000 words long.
